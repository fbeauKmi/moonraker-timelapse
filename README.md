## Small history of this project ##

I recently build a (VORON 2.4)[https://www.vorondesign.com/voron2.4]  and switch my main printer from Marlin/Octoprint to klipper/mainsail. Octoprint offers many plugins, huge community, ... whatever. I used to make timelapses with a SONY FDR-AX700 camera with Octolapse, to get stabilization, and easy support for DSLR cameras.

SONY FDR-AX700 is not a DSLR and is controlled via WIFI AP of the camera 

## What a script based camera ? ## 

As Octolapse do, this component use shell script to control DSLR and other cameras. More information (here)[https://github.com/FormerLurker/octolapse/wiki/V0.4---Configuring-a-DSLR#step-6---configure-octolapse]
